/// ContactLocation class from Contact vocabulary
///
/// A place, or mobile situation, with address, phone number, fax, etc. Related to a person by home, office, etc. Note one person's workplace may be another person's home. A person may have more than one home and more than one workplace. (In practice it sometimes maybe useful with restriucted datasets to assume that this is not the case, when extracting data from other ontologies with no concept of ContactLocation). Strongly related to a person: in some ways a role that a person can be in.
