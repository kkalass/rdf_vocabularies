///
/// A DefinedRegion is a geographic area defined by potentially arbitrary (rather than political, administrative or natural geographical) criteria. Properties are provided for defining a region by reference to sets of postal codes.
///
/// Examples: a delivery destination when shopping. Region where regional pricing is configured.
///
/// Requirement 1:
/// Country: US
/// States: "NY", "CA"
///
/// Requirement 2:
/// Country: US
/// PostalCode Set: { [94000-94585], [97000, 97999], [13000, 13599]}
/// { [12345, 12345], [78945, 78945], }
/// Region = state, canton, prefecture, autonomous community...

/// - StructuredValue (https://schema.org/StructuredValue)
