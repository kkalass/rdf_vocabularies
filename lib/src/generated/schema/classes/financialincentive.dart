  ///
  /// Describes the amount that can be redeemed from this incentive.
  ///
  /// <p>{[QuantitativeValue]}: Use this for incentives based on price (either raw amount or percentage-based). For a raw amount example, "You can claim $2,500 - $7,500 from the total cost of installation" would be represented as the following:</p>
  /// {
  /// "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
  /// “minValue”: 2500,
  /// “maxValue”: 7500,
  /// "unitCode": "USD"
  /// }
  /// <p>{[QuantitivateValue]} can also be used for percentage amounts. In such cases, value is used to represent the incentive’s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type. For example, "You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation, up to a maximum of $7,500" would be:</p>
  /// {
  /// "@type": "QuantitativeValue",
  /// "value": 30,
  /// "unitCode": "P1",
  /// "unitText": "%",
  /// “maxValue”: 7500,
  /// “valueReference”: “USD”
  /// }
  /// <p>{[UnitPriceSpecification]}: Use this for incentives that are based on amounts rather than price. For example, a net metering rebate that pays $10/kWh, up to $1,000:</p>
  /// {
  /// "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",
  /// "price": 10,
  /// "priceCurrency": "USD",
  /// "referenceQuantity": 1,
  /// "unitCode": "DO3",
  /// "unitText": "kw/h",
  /// "maxPrice": 1000,
  /// "description": "$10 / kwh up to $1000"
  /// }
  /// <p>{[LoanOrCredit]}: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like:</p>
  /// {
  /// "@type": "LoanOrCredit",
  /// "loanTerm": {
  /// "@type":"QuantitativeValue",
  /// "value":"10",
  /// "unitCode": "ANN"
