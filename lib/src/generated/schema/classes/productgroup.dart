/// ProductGroup class from Schema vocabulary
///
/// A ProductGroup represents a group of {[Product]}s that vary only in certain well-described ways, such as by {[size]}, {[color]}, {[material]} etc.
///
/// While a ProductGroup itself is not directly offered for sale, the various varying products that it represents can be. The ProductGroup serves as a prototype or template, standing in for all of the products who have an {[isVariantOf]} relationship to it. As such, properties (including additional types) can be applied to the ProductGroup to represent characteristics shared by each of the (possibly very many) variants. Properties that reference a ProductGroup are not included in this mechanism; neither are the following specific properties {[variesBy]}, {[hasVariant]}, {[url]}.
