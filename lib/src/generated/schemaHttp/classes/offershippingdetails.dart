///
/// OfferShippingDetails represents information about shipping destinations.
///
/// Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping rates for different destinations:
///
/// One entity for Alaska/Hawaii. A different one for continental US. A different one for all France.
///
/// Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping costs and delivery times.
///
/// Two entities that are identical but differ in rate and time:
///
/// E.g. Cheaper and slower: $5 in 5-7 days
/// or Fast and expensive: $15 in 1-2 days.
///
/// Inherits from:
/// - Intangible (http://schema.org/Intangible)
/// - StructuredValue (http://schema.org/StructuredValue)
/// - Thing (http://schema.org/Thing)
///
