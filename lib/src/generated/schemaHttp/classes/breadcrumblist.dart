/// BreadcrumbList class from SchemaHttp vocabulary
///
/// A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.\n\nThe {[position]} property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList. The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an {[itemListOrder]} of {[ItemListOrderAscending]} (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the "top" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list.

ListItem is used with ordered lists when you want to provide additional context about the element in that list or when the same item might be in different places in different lists.\n\nNote: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for indicating the order or elements.
