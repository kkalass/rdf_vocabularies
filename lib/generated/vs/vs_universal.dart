///
/// Universal properties are RDF properties that have no explicitly defined domain
/// and can therefore be applied to any resource within this vocabulary's context.
/// In RDF, when a property has no rdfs:domain constraint, it can theoretically be
/// used with any subject, but best practice is to use them only within
/// the intended vocabulary context.
///
/// This class collects all such properties from the Vs vocabulary to make them
/// easily accessible without cluttering the class-specific property interfaces.
