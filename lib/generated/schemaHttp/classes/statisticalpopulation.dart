/// StatisticalPopulation class from SchemaHttp vocabulary
///
/// A StatisticalPopulation is a set of instances of a certain given type that satisfy some set of constraints. The property {[populationType]} is used to specify the type. Any property that can be used on instances of that type can appear on the statistical population. For example, a {[StatisticalPopulation]} representing all {[Person]}s with a {[homeLocation]} of East Podunk California would be described by applying the appropriate {[homeLocation]} and {[populationType]} properties to a {[StatisticalPopulation]} item that stands for that set of people.
/// The properties {[numConstraints]} and {[constraintProperty]} are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of "population" used here is the general sense of a statistical
/// population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a {[populationType]} of {[Event]} or {[NewsArticle]} could be used. See also {[Observation]}, where a {[populationType]} such as {[Person]} or {[Event]} can be indicated directly. In most cases it may be better to use {[StatisticalVariable]} instead of {[StatisticalPopulation]}.
