/// ConstraintNode class from Schema vocabulary
///
/// The ConstraintNode type is provided to support usecases in which a node in a structured data graph is described with properties which appear to describe a single entity, but are being used in a situation where they serve a more abstract purpose. A {[ConstraintNode]} can be described using {[constraintProperty]} and {[numConstraints]}. These constraint properties can serve a
/// variety of purposes, and their values may sometimes be understood to indicate sets of possible values rather than single, exact and specific values.
///
/// Inherits from:
/// - Intangible (https://schema.org/Intangible)
/// - Thing (https://schema.org/Thing)
///
/// This class provides access to all properties that can be used with ConstraintNode.
/// [Class Reference](https://schema.org/ConstraintNode)

  ///
  /// An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. Typically the value is a URI-identified RDF class, and in this case corresponds to the
  /// use of rdf:type in RDF. Text values can be used sparingly, for cases where useful information can be added without their being an appropriate schema to reference. In the case of text values, the class label should follow the schema.org <a href="https://schema.org/docs/styleguide.html">style guide</a>.
