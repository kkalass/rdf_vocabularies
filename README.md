## Overview

[üåê **Official Homepage**](https://kkalass.github.io/rdf_vocabularies/)

`rdf_vocabularies` is a collection of well known RDF vocabularies as Dart constants, grouped in classes. The library provides a type-safe way to work with RDF data in Dart applications, making it easier to build Semantic Web and Linked Data applications.

## Features

- **Type-safe RDF terms**: Access common RDF vocabulary terms as typed Dart constants
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Each term includes its original description from the vocabulary
- **Two usage approaches**:
  - For RDF beginners: Use generated class-specific constants (e.g., `SchemaPerson.name`)
  - For RDF experts: Access the full vocabulary (e.g., `Schema.Person`, `Schema.name`)

## Getting Started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rdf_vocabularies: ^0.1.0-dev
  rdf_core: ^0.7.6  # Required for RDF data structures
```

Then run:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Usage

### For Dart Developers New to RDF

If you're new to RDF but want to use RDF data with specific types of resources (like a Person), the library provides convenient class-specific constants:

```dart
import 'package:rdf_core/rdf_core.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/schema.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/src/generated/schema/classes/person.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a person using blank node and class-specific constants
  final personNode = BlankNode();
  final graph = MemoryGraph();
  
  // Use SchemaPerson.classIri to specify the type
  graph.add(Triple(
    personNode,
    RdfTerms.type,  // rdf:type from rdf_core
    SchemaPerson.classIri,
  ));
  
  // Use class-specific property constants for better discoverability
  graph.add(Triple(
    personNode,
    SchemaPerson.name,
    LiteralNode.fromString('Jane Doe'),
  ));
  
  graph.add(Triple(
    personNode,
    SchemaPerson.email,
    LiteralNode.fromString('jane.doe@example.com'),
  ));
}
```

### For Experienced RDF Developers

If you're already familiar with RDF and know exactly which vocabulary terms you need, you can use the full vocabulary classes:

```dart
import 'package:rdf_core/rdf_core.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/schema.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a person with a specific IRI and use full vocabulary terms
  final personIri = IriNode.fromString('http://example.org/person/jane_doe');
  final graph = MemoryGraph();
  
  // Use Schema.Person to specify the type
  graph.add(Triple(
    personIri,
    RdfTerms.type,  // rdf:type from rdf_core
    Schema.Person,
  ));
  
  // Use full vocabulary property constants
  graph.add(Triple(
    personIri,
    Schema.name,
    LiteralNode.fromString('Jane Doe'),
  ));
  
  // Create a complex structure: a postal address
  final addressNode = BlankNode();
  graph.add(Triple(personIri, Schema.address, addressNode));
  graph.add(Triple(addressNode, RdfTerms.type, Schema.PostalAddress));
  graph.add(Triple(
    addressNode,
    Schema.streetAddress,
    LiteralNode.fromString('123 Main St'),
  ));
}
```

## Supported Vocabularies

Currently, the following vocabularies are supported:

- **Schema.org** (`schema`): A collaborative, community activity to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data

More vocabularies will be added in future releases.
