## Overview

[üåê **Official Homepage**](https://kkalass.github.io/rdf_vocabularies/)

`rdf_vocabularies` provides type-safe access to standard RDF vocabulary terms as Dart constants for use with [`rdf_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/rdf_core). 

The library is designed for both RDF newcomers and experts, offering structured ways to work with semantic data while maintaining compilation-time safety.

## Part of a whole family of projects

If you are looking for more rdf-related functionality, have a look at our companion projects:

* basic graph classes as well as turtle/jsonld/n-triple serialization and parsing: [rdf_core](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_core) 
* parse and serialize rdf/xml format: [rdf_xml](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_xml) 
* generate your own easy-to-use constants for other vocabularies with a build_runner: [rdf_vocabulary_to_dart](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_vocabulary_to_dart)
* map Dart Objects ‚ÜîÔ∏è RDF: [rdf_mapper](https://github.com/kkalass/rdf_mapper)

## Package Characteristics

- **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Nearly all content is composed of compile-time constants
- **Small Binary Size**: Minimal impact on your application's size
- **Type Safety**: Catch vocabulary usage errors at compile time
- **IDE Assistance**: Get autocompletion and documentation directly in your editor

## Features

- **Dual Interface**: Choose between class-specific access for beginners or full vocabulary access for experts
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Access terms from popular RDF vocabularies (Schema.org, FOAF, Dublin Core, etc.)
- **Rich Documentation**: Each term includes its original description from the vocabulary
- **Seamless Integration**: Works perfectly with the `rdf_core` library

## Getting Started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  rdf_vocabularies: ^0.1.0-dev
  rdf_core: ^0.7.6  # Required for RDF data structures
```

## Usage

### For RDF Newcomers: Class-Specific Approach

If you're new to RDF, the class-specific approach guides you to use the correct properties for each type of resource:

```dart
import 'package:rdf_core/rdf_core.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/schema.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/xsd.dart';

void main() {
  final personIri = IriTerm('http://example.org/person/jane_doe');
  final addressNode = BlankNodeTerm();
  
  // Create a graph with triples using class-specific constants
  final graph = RdfGraph.fromTriples([
    // Declare the resource type using SchemaPerson constants
    Triple(personIri, SchemaPerson.rdfType, SchemaPerson.classIri),
    
    // Use properties specific to Person - your IDE will help you discover valid properties
    Triple(personIri, SchemaPerson.name, LiteralTerm.string('Jane Doe')),
    Triple(personIri, SchemaPerson.email, LiteralTerm.string('jane.doe@example.com')),
    Triple(personIri, SchemaPerson.birthDate, LiteralTerm('1990-01-01', datatype: Xsd.date)),

    // Even those defined in other vocabularies, if their relationship is known to the library
    Triple(personIri, SchemaPerson.foafAge, LiteralTerm.integer(42)),

    // For properties from foreign vocabularies that are not restricted to a specific class, 
    // but are designed to be used universally, you can use the generated UniversalProperties
    // classes. 
    Triple(personIri, DcUniversalProperties.creator, LiteralTerm.string('System')),

    // Create a complex structure with an address
    Triple(personIri, SchemaPerson.address, addressNode),
    Triple(addressNode, SchemaPostalAddress.rdfType, SchemaPostalAddress.classIri),
    Triple(addressNode, SchemaPostalAddress.streetAddress, LiteralTerm.string('123 Main St')),
    Triple(addressNode, SchemaPostalAddress.addressLocality, LiteralTerm.string('Anytown')),
  ]);
}
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Your IDE shows only relevant properties for each class
- Compile-time type safety prevents mixing incompatible vocabulary terms
- Discoverability through autocomplete helps you learn the vocabulary structure

### For RDF Experts: Full Vocabulary Approach

Experienced RDF developers who know exactly which vocabulary terms they need can use the more direct full vocabulary classes:

```dart
import 'package:rdf_core/rdf_core.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/schema.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/rdf.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/foaf.dart';
import 'package:rdf_vocabularies/xsd.dart';

void main() {
  final personIri = IriTerm('http://example.org/person/jane_doe');
  final addressNode = BlankNodeTerm();
  
  // Create a graph with direct vocabulary access
  final graph = RdfGraph.fromTriples([
    Triple(personIri, Rdf.type, Schema.Person),
    
    // Mix properties from different vocabularies freely
    Triple(personIri, Schema.name, LiteralTerm.string('Jane Doe')),
    Triple(personIri, Foaf.age, LiteralTerm.integer(42)),
    Triple(personIri, Schema.email, LiteralTerm.string('jane.doe@example.com')),
    
    // Create a complex structure with an address
    Triple(personIri, Schema.address, addressNode),
    Triple(addressNode, Rdf.type, Schema.PostalAddress),
    Triple(addressNode, Schema.streetAddress, LiteralTerm.string('123 Main St')),
  ]);
}
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Maximally flexible - combine terms from any vocabulary
- More concise syntax for those who know exactly what they need
- Natural for developers coming from other RDF environments

## Supported Vocabularies
